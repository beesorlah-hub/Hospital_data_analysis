## Overview
This project analyzes Hospital data using Structured Query Language(SQL) to extract insights related to :
- Readmission rates
- Patient Satisfaction
- Cost per condition and procedure
- Length of stay tends

## Insights
- Total Cost spent on each Condition:- Ths analysis showed the Total cost each of the conditions with cancer with total cost of 1650000 and Allergic Reaction with less cost of 6600
- count of readmission patients by gender:- showed that out of 264 readmission cases, 230 of which are female while a 34 patients where male
- Average length of stay per procedure:- This showed that Surgery and Chemotherpy has a high Average length of stay of 42.65 while Epinephrine Injection has a low  Average length of stay of 34.24
-  count of readmission patients showed that out of the 984 patients 264 of which are Readmission while 720 patients are not readmission.
-  Readmission rate by condition:- This showed that Readmission Rate increase by 100 for patients with Heart Attack condition, while Childbirth, Kidneystone and five other conditions has no readmission rate
-   Patients satisfaction by outcome: -Data showed that Patient who recovered from out come have an Average satisfaction of 3.8 while patient stable outcome have 3.2
-   Condition per Age group:- showed that patients that are aged from 66 and above have high patient count for Heart Attack, Hypertension, Stroke, Osteoarthritis, Cancer and Diabetes compared to other age group.
-   condition by Gender :- Showed that Female patients are suffering from many health conditions compared the male.
-   Readmission rate by age group:- Showed that patient with the age range from 51 and above has high Readmission rate
-   Cost by procedure and age group:- Showed that patient with the age range from 51 and above send high of cost on treatment
 -   patient satisfactory by age group: Satisfactory rate increases from elderly to the young
## Recommendation
- Cost Management :- Implement preventive measures and early detection programs to reduce long-term cancer treatment expenses.
- Improving Length of Stay Efficiency:- Since surgeries and chemotherapy have the highest average stay, hospitals should optimize care pathways to reduce unnecessary hospital stays.
- Patient Satisfaction Improvement:- Since recovered patients have higher satisfaction (3.8) than those with stable outcomes (3.2), focus on enhancing the recovery process and patient support systems.
- Targeted Healthcare Programs for Elderly Patients:- As patients aged 65 and above have a high prevalence of severe conditions (Heart Attack, Hypertension, Stroke, etc.), hospitals should develop specialized geriatric healthcare programs.
Conduct regular screenings and preventive measures for these conditions in elderly populations.
- Gender-Specific Healthcare Initiatives:- With female patients having more health conditions, specialized women's health programs should be implemented.
Ensure gender-inclusive healthcare policies for better medical accessibility and treatment outcomes.
## Conclusion
The analysis highlights critical areas of healthcare efficiency, cost distribution, patient demographics, and readmission trends. The findings suggest the need for cost management, readmission reduction strategies, improved patient satisfaction initiatives, and specialized care for elderly and female patients. By implementing these recommendations, healthcare institutions can optimize resource utilization, enhance patient outcomes, and improve overall healthcare quality.
